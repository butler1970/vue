# Introduction
This vue application was initialized in using Docker and the following command line instructions.

```
mkdir vue && cd "$_" && docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/$(basename `pwd`)" -w "/$(basename `pwd`)" -it node:lts-alpine sh -c "yarn global add @vue/cli && vue create ."
```

This vue application was containerized using the following reference.  [vue-with-docker-initialize-develop-and-build](https://medium.com/@jwdobken/vue-with-docker-initialize-develop-and-build-51fad21ad5e6).  Note that the instructions use the image 'node:11.1-alpine' however that version of node is not sufficient to run the latest version of vue.js.  Therefore, this application's creation deviated from those instructions by using image 'node:lts-alpine' instead.
