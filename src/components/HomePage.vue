      <p>Welcome to <strong>InternetTools.app!</strong> I've constructed this site to sharpen my development skills and
        experiment with some technologies which have become popular as of late to see what all of the buzz is about.
        Specifically, I am intrigued about comprehending the manner in which <strong>Docker</strong> containers can act
        as a substitute for the typical virtual machine within a development environment to maintain developmental
        dependencies disassociated from the host device.</p>

      <p>In my journeys I've also discovered that as far as PHP frameworks go, <strong>Laravel</strong> seems to have
        the most evolved containerization experience allowing for creating a fully working LAMP stack with container
        orchestration right out of the box. Through my research into popular Laravel frontend frameworks, I've observed
        <strong>Vue.js</strong> growing rapidly in usage, making it worthwhile to supplement my Laravel knowledge with
        complementary familiarity in Vue.js and round out my full-stack skills. With my past experience developing
        various projects in <strong>React</strong> spanning several years, the ease of working with Vue.js in initial
        use has been a refreshing change so far in comparison. In particular, I find the data binding model refreshing
        in it's simplicity.</p>

      <p>Welcome to <strong>InternetTools.app</strong>! I've constructed this site to sharpen my development skills and
        experiment with some technologies which have become popular as of late to see what all of the buzz is about. In
        particular I'm interested in understanding how <strong>Docker</strong> containers can be used in place of the
        typical virtual machine in a development environment to keep development dependencies off of the host machine.
